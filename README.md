## Overview
TorchSpatial offers a comprehensive framework and benchmark suite designed to advance spatial representation learning (SRL). It supports the development and evaluation of location encoders using extensive benchmarks and innovative evaluation metrics. The documentation is [here](https://torchspatial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Features
- **Unified Framework**: Integrates 15 recognized location encoders to enhance scalability and reproducibility.
- **LocBench Benchmark**: Includes 17 datasets for geo-aware image classification and regression, enabling thorough performance assessments across various geographic distributions.
- **Geo-Bias Score**: A novel metric to evaluate model performance and geographic bias, promoting spatial fairness in GeoAI applications.

## Availability
Access the TorchSpatial framework, LocBench benchmarks, and evaluation metrics on GitHub: [TorchSpatial GitHub Repository](https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial).

## Overall Framework
![TorchSpatial Overall Framework](figs/TorchSpatial_overall_framework1.png)

## Environment Settings  
Please ensure that the package versions used in your environment match those specified in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial/blob/main/main/requirements.txt).

## Code Execution
Example bash scripts for running the code are available in the [main/run_bash](https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial/tree/main/main/run_sh) folder. A detailed tutorial can be found in the following Jupyter notebook: [tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial/blob/main/main/tutorial.ipynb).  


## Dataset Download Instructions  
1. You can **download the dataset** from the following DOI link: [Download Data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.26026798
        
        ). As we have performed data cleaning and preprocessing, please use the provided dataset to ensure the code functions correctly.
2. Please **update the paths** in [paths.py](https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial/blob/main/main/paths.py) to reflect the locations of the datasets on your system accurately.

## Geo-Bias Score 
We have another repository specifically designed for geo-bias calculations: [PyGBS](https://github.com/seai-lab/PyGBS/tree/main). In this repository, we support more geo-bias scores than described in the TorchSpatial paper. Notice that the **base geo-bias score** and **relative geo-bias score** discussed in the current TorchSpatial paper are renamed as the _Unmarked SSI_ and _Marked SSI_ respectively, in order to provide more information on how these different geo-bias scores are defined and computed differently.
 
## Results
Table 1: The Top1 classification accuracy of different models on 7 geo-aware image classification datasets in LocBench benchmark. GPT-4V is tested with zero-shot settings, and * indicates that we resample 100 images from each dataset's test/validation set except BirdSnap and Birdsnapâ€  whose whose test sets are used for evaluation. "Avg" column indicates the average performance of each model on all five species recognition datasets. **Bold** indicates the best models in Group B and C.

Table2: The R square of different models on 4 geo-aware image regression datasets in LocBench benchmark. Same format as above.
![R square](figs/img_reg_eval.png)

The average runtime for BirdSnap, BirdSnapâ€ , NABirdsâ€ , and YFCC is within 5 minutes, and 10 to 20 minutes for iNat2017, iNat2018, and fMow.
The number of training for each model on each dataset is one. Same as evaluation.
All our experiments were conducted on a Ubuntu workstation equipped with 4 NVIDIA RTX A5500 GPUs each of which has 24 GB memory.
